### Who we are
About a year ago our engineering team implement Plasma protocol designed by Vitlik Buterin and Joseph Poon during the ETHWatterlo hackathon, our project was noted by Vitalik in his twitter. Since that moment we started working on our Plasma protocol implementation in close contact with the Ethereum team.

### What we do
Plasma is scaling solution for the Ethereum network that can significantly speed up it and make it cheaper.  Our benchmarks show 22000 transactions per second with the commission about 0.005$ per transaction. As a reference, the bandwidth of the main ethereum network is about 15 transactions per second with a commission 0.3$ - 1$.

To utilize plasma bandwidth, we are going to build the product ecosystem around together with our partners. The application that we are focused on is:
- Decentralized exchanges, plasma perfectly fits here as a core part of such services.
- Tokenization platforms for financial instruments and their derivatives. Tokens of such asset types have a strict relationship with cash flow in the real world. Since they have a value, we expect inquiry for a significant amount of trading operations on such type of assets.
- Plasma as payment tool for the general public. We believe that with a proper level of UI/UX for the ordinary users and small companies can bring a significant amount of transactions into plasma.

Our roadmap consists of the next steps.
- Run plasma in production which means:
  - Publish plasma Smart Contract on the Ethereum main net. That contract is a core part of plasma. It allows users to deposit their funds to plasma and provide guarantees that they can withdraw the funds in case of any cheating or even if plasma servers stop working.
  - Deploy infrastructure layer to production. That layer mainly consists of machines that process transactions and keep legger in a distributed database.
- Implement “Confidential transactions” feature based on zero-knowledge proofs.
- In the long term bring modern cryptographical advances, such as zkSNARKs/zkSTARKs to prove a complete validity of a block and reduce a full chain monitoring burden for users

### Monetization
After bringing significant amount of transactions to our plasma installations company can earn a significant amount of commission payments. 
For example, 150 of 22000 possible transactions per second in plasma with 0.005$ commission can bring about 2M$ monthly.

### Tokens
At some point, we are going to issue the token that people will use to pay commission.

### Open Certificates Initiative
We also see that the products mentioned above at some point will be faced with AML/KYC regulation requirements. To help companies meet that requirements we work on the - open certificates standart that will shift rights and responsibilities to manage personal data from the companies to the end user and at the same time with the help of blockchain and cryptography end user can guarantee that personal data, that he provides is trustworthy.
